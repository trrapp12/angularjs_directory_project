### Description:
---

The parallax effect assigns x, y, and z values to separate graphic elements and then calculates actions and movement in response to the movement of the mouse or to the tilt of the tablet if you are on a tablet or phone with an accelerometer.  

I used the parallax.js library from [Matthew Wagerfield](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for the javascript. Therefore I cannot take credit for the logic that controls the motion.
