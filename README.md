#####--Because I love Avengers--

###Description: 
avengers_agents_of_shield_directory is a directory search web-application.  I built it so I could practice working with MVC or MV* architecture in AngularJS.  I'm posting it to show future employers my technical proficiency.  It is a great place to see some of the FrontEnd work I can do.  I loved doing the project and I think you'll find it's kind of fun too.  

###What can you get from looking at it? 

* If you're a potential employer, you can see what work I've done.
* If you're a fellow coder take a look around.  If you can learn something great, if you can teach me something greater!
* If you're my family you can see that yes, I was actually doing something with myself these past 3 months and no that did not mean COD III or Black Ops II.

###Okay, but really what is this showing me?
This project does a couple of really cool things that are able to be applied in many situations. 

* Utilizes the concept of modules to create more readable and manageable code that applies DRY principles.
* Utilized MVC/MVW architecture
* created three different controllers that receive user input and makes calls to model objects and the view to       perform appropriate actions
* created a module that uses ng-route and $routeProvider to direct the consumer to the appropriate urls and views.
* uses $http to read a JSON object
* filters content using directives
* uses two-way data binding to make queries
* uses deep-linking to navigate through views


###I like what I see, what do I do now?
